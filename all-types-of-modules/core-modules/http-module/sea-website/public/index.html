    <h1>Aegean Sea</h1>
    <p>
      The Aegean Sea is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea between
      Europe and Asia. It is located between the Balkans and Anatolia, and
      covers an area of some 215,000 square kilometres. In the north, the Aegean
      is connected to the Marmara Sea, which in turn connects to the Black Sea,
      by the straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, respectively. The
      Aegean Islands are located within the sea and some bound it on its
      southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes. The sea reaches a maximum
      depth of 2,639m to the west of Karpathos. The Thracian Sea and the Sea of
      Crete are main subdivisions of the Aegean Sea...
